## FAQ for Recruiters


**1. Are you interested in new opportunities?** <br>
Depends. If it is your run-of-the-mill, straight-out-of-a-Dilbert-comic position, then No.
If it is a chance to work on exciting projects, build data visualizations, interact with different areas of business, all the while having fun with data, then yes.

**2. Where are you located? Are you open for relocation?** <br>
I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Yes, I am open for relocation.

**3. Are you authorized to work in the U.S?** <br>
Yes. I have an H1B work authorization.

**4. Why should I hire you?** <br>
The snarky me says, isn't that for you to determine?<br>
The sensible me says, because I know blah, have worked on blah and can do blah.<br>
The smart me says, because I satisfy a need you have.<br>
