First of all, I wish you a very happy new year.

If you visited my site before, you'll notice that things are newer here. New theme, new section, new profile and of course a new post.
This year, I resolved to make more data driven decisions in my life, be it forming an opinion about a topic, judging someone's performance or even deciding how I am going to spend my work day.
Of course, this also means I will be working on a **lot** more data projects this year.
I'll list here some of the projects I want to tackle in the upcoming month or two. This includes both my professional affiliations as well as personal ones.

* Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms: It's an exploitation vs. exploration tradeoff problem and I will be looking into it's appplicability in Adaptive learning space.

* Bayesian Knowledge Tracing: There has been some research done by colleague, <a href="https://twitter.com/stevepolyak"> Steve Polyak </a> on Collaborative Problem Solving using Knowledge Tracing. I hope to understand the techniques used in his paper better and possibly extend the work.
- Makeover Monday: The popular data reimagination project using publicly available data and vizes over <a href="https://makeovermonday.co.uk"> here </a> to get myself back in the data visualization groove. Intially I plan to use Tableau and then revisit the datasets using d3.

- Crime Statistics in India: This has been something that has intrigued me for quite some time. It was only recently that I started working on it. The project is big, with significant data challenges, so I'll keep you updated with more details via a dedicated post.


Of these, the first two are more theoretical, and work related projects. The other two are personal and would produce artifacts which I hope to share in the upcoming weeks.

## Happy 2017
