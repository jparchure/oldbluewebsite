Last week, ACT, the organization I work in, organized its annual Analytics Symposium. The speaker list featured distinguished researchers and industry stalwarts from the fields of Psychometrics, Learning Analytics and Data Science.
Based on the presentations, here are some of my thoughts as a Knowledge worker.

**Mandatory Disclaimer**: The thoughts expressed here are my own and do not reflect the opinions of ACT Inc in any way.

1. **Psychometrics**- The scientific basis of assessments, looking forward, still remains a rock solid foundation of psychological theories and statistical models.
2. **Learning Analytics**- It is the new player on the block which focuses on collecting data with the help of technology based platforms and then running advanced techniques such as Machine Learning to discover new patterns in learning progressions
3. **Games for learning**- Move aside lame textbox based trivial imitations of Dora the explorer. With Virtual Reality and Augmented reality slowly creeping into real possibilities from the curtains of science fiction, there have been leaps in the way games are treated in education.
Be it <a href="http://www.simcity.com/en_US/simcityedu"> SimCityEdu </a> for assessment or <a href="http://ecolearn.gse.harvard.edu/ecoMOBILE/overview.php"> EcoMobile </a>, an augmented reality game to help students learn more about their ecosystem, educational researchers are embracing new game technologies much more than their predecessors.
4. **Avenues of Data**- With technology pervading our lives, several new avenues of collecting data have opened up. Thanks to IoT, several new sources of data can be built for little money. The question in that case is not how you get the data but what do you make of it. Just like the way clickstream transformed online shopping, I believe it is time for education to head in a direction very different than the traditional linear way of learning, which is a vestige of the industrial revolution.
5. **Future of Assessments**- This is a phrase which I neither have the space nor the background to go into detail. However, based on the point above, future psychometric research will have to take into accounts the new types of data and where they stem from. How do you measure technological ability, do they affect other skills, what is their impact on/from non-cognitive factors? All these questions will need to be looked into.
6. **Actionability**- All the journal papers, all the ML models, all the adaptive learning platforms and games are worth little if they are not acted upon. Right now we have lots of data, extensive theories and brilliant minds working on how to help students learn better. The question is, what is being done about it. Science can inform, discover new ideas and address concerns but it is on people to implement them. The policy makers, political representatives, community leaders, social workers, teachers, parents and most importantly students have to act on the findings and recommendations.

In the end, I believe no amount of technology can help us succeed as a society without a crucial element- people. Without addressing the socio-economic concerns of the most vulnerable, we cannot simply hope to wave the magic wand of data and relieve them of their troubles. It is no good having a customised learning plan if the student comes to class hungry. A student who lives in squalor and sees people shoot needles in their veins behind his house on a daily basis will have hard time figuring out how ADP turns to ATP during photosynthesis. Of course that freckled girl who is bullied during lunch every day will have a low score in "Motivation". It does not matter to her if we use a lambda value of 1e-5 or 1e-4 in our L1 regularization.
<br>Hence, all of us as a community, have to come together, to not just recognize, but address the challenges faced by millions of students and teachers in the battlefield of education. Technology, can be a vital aid in this process.

As they say, it takes a village.
