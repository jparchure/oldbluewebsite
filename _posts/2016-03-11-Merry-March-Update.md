title: Merry March Update
author: Jay

I am sick of hearing the term "March Madness" everywhere and the NCAA Tournament hasn't even started yet. Crazy Right? So I changed the title to something different.
So, what has been going on in my life, you ask?
A lot and yet so little.

On Feb 23, my idea was chosen in the top 3 of ACT's bi-annual Idea recognition event called Bloom Out Loud. Only one of the three got to be crowd favorite (sadly it wasn't mine), but it was fun to discuss something I have been working on for a while infront of the whole company. Ofcourse, I can't share what it was here because of company privacy issues, but it was using an existing concept to come up with a new business idea. Even though I didn't win, my idea was validated by several business leaders who came up to me to discuss next steps, once the event was over.

In the non-work related stuff, I have been following this amazing (and free) book called <a href= "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/IPSUR/vignettes/IPSUR.pdf"> "Introduction to Probability and Statistics Using R" </a> to brush up on my stats. Coming from a strong software development background, I was struggling to find a good resource to not just be a refresher on stats but also to relate to my existing programming knowledge. This book can be used with standard R  and doesn't require you to go hunt for datasets, like many well-intentioned resources on the web do. But an important note, you need to be comfortable with programming before you jump right in. As the author says- <i>...the title of this book is “Introduction to Probability and Statistics Using R”, and not “Introduction to R Using Probability and Statistics”, nor even “Introduction
to Probability and Statistics and R Using Words”...</i>

On Tuesday, March 8, I attended a local Developer <a href="http://www.meetup.com/techcorridorio/events/229325772/"> Meetup </a> held in a small bar in Downtown Iowa City. It was a valuable opportunity to connect with several talented people working on very challenging technical problems. The gentleman I was talking with, worked for the State of Iowa and managed health data for a specific disease. Being in a company myself, were we have to be very meticulous and careful about using our data, I was able to understand and empathize with the non-technical challenges of data management that many not-for-profit data-intensive organizations have to tackle on a continous basis.

Moving on from the Data world, I have been playing badminton for the past few weeks now. I joined the Badminton Club at the U(niversity of Iowa) and join them every Tuesday and Thursday. Despite being off court for close to two years, I pleasantly discovered I hadn't rusted a lot. The only issue apart from some glaring intermediate-level game flaws was fitness. I ran out of breath after just two doubles games and had to take a break for about 10 minutes or so. Physical issues aside, playing badminton is a lot of fun, it gets your adrenaline pumping and makes your reflexes sharper.
