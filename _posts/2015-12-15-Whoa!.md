Hello fellow Programmer!<br>
Or atleast an ex-programmer,<br>
Or a Data analyst,
Or maybe you accidentally landed here, in that case
<br> *in a deep throaty voice* <b>Hello Stranger.</b><br>
It's been quite a while since I last updated my github page.<br>
Not that I have not been programming, but rather I haven't had the chance to tidy up my github landing page.<br>
So now that you are here. Feel free to poke around. I'll be adding some more stuff (hopefully) regularly from now on.<br>
Best<br>
J
