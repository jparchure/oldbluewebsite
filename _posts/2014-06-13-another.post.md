### Welcome
Hello Guys! This is Jay here. I go to school at The University of Iowa for my Masters in Computer Science.
I have been on GitHub for a while, but only recently did I create a landing page for my repositories.
My recent work on Ruby on Rails and D3.js has been committed <a href="http://github.com/jparchure"> here </a><br>
Best<br>
