I have been busy with lots of stuff recently, no wonder it has been a while since I posted.
A small preview of what I have been upto-
<h3>Drawing</h3>
I have always wanted to learn to how to draw, so this month I decided to act on my long time desires.
I got this book off ebay and decided to give it a shot.<br>

Surprisingly enough, this book does deliver on its promise of teaching absolute newbies who can't even draw a proper straight line, to draw. The progress is slow, (I am still on Lesson 3) but hey I am atleast moving. <br>
<h3> Data Science </h3>
There has been a lot of back and forth movement in this area. Despite my theoretical background in Machine Learning algorithms and evaluating them with Weka, I find it challenging to write predictive programs. I am still confused between Pandas and R as I know a little bit of both but not enough for an objective evaluation. Hopefully, this new project I am working on (details soon) will provide enough thrust for takeoff. Once I get in the air, it should be a smooth ride. The reason I am so confident is because it has been a trend with me in the past. Often, I struggle, sometime vehemently to learn a new tool/language. But then there comes a tipping point, when I go through problems like Christian McCaffrey through the Iowa Defense. It happened with Python, it happened with JavaScript and now it's going to happen with Machine Learning, irrespective of the tool I end up choosing.

<h3> Reading </h3>
I am currently reading two books. <br>
The first one, Nate Silver's- "The Signal and The Noise" talks about the science of predictions. It discusses in depth on why so many predictions go wrong and explores the ones that are right.
The second book <i>Between the World and me</i> is written by the acclaimed black author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates, who shares his experience and travails of growing up in the post Jim Crow era. His insights on the psyche of an African-American community, their pains, their struggles and their relations with other races is compelling and thought provoking.
