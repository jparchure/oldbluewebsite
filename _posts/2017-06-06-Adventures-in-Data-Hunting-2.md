title : Adventures in Data (Viz) Hunting II

Sorry for the long gap. I started a new position as Senior BI Analyst at Target and was busy adjusting to the new job and city.

In today's adventures in Data Hunting, I'll showcase three data visualizations that caught my fancy in the wild seas of Internet. What makes them interesting? Let's take a look-

Maps are common in the data viz ecosystem. Therefore, finding one that is informative yet novel is a hard task. The creator, Andy Woodruff, visualizes the line of sight from coastlines by using cartographic projections. The seemingly innocuos problem is complicated by earth's curvature and coastal geography. He explains the development process in the accompanying post.

Don't let the polarizing header image put you off. This is not just an excellent piece of journalism, but also uses data visualization effectively to paint a narrative. A common use case in data visualization is showing the composition of an entity. Anyone get pie-chart nightmares? But if not pie chart, what else?
In this piece, the team at New America uses a collection of shapes along with a bar chart. The individual elements that make up the viz are interactive and thus information dense. The maps are static, but a consistent use of color and clean labels helps paint a compelling narrative.

Firstly, <a href="pudding.cool"> The Pudding </a> is my favorite website. A big shoutout to their <a href="https://pudding.cool/about/#team"> team </a> for creating such rich, interactive, and yet, easy to understand data journalism pieces. This one tackles an interesting problem, how to encode a boolean variable and its effect on the data. We all think of different attributes of the data points such as color, shape and size but rarely do we consider using the frame of reference, in this case, the axes as a variable. <a href="https://twitter.com/codenberg"> Russell Goldenberg </a> goes into the details of the visualization, complete with a working example and code.
