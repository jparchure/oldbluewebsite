<p>
Over the course of April and May, I was fortunate to attend two professional conferences. It's part of the skill development initiatives that the Office for Innovation offers here at ACT.</p>
<p>
The first one, the <a href="https://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/data-visualization-innovation-summit-san-francisco-2016">Data Visualization Innovation Summit </a> took place on April 21 & 22 2016, in San Francisco. It was centered around discussing novel ways in which organizations were using Data Visualization concepts to drive innovation. Though there were some detailed technical discussions, it was mostly about discussing concepts, workflows and processes.
</p><p>
The second, more recent one was the <a href="http://www.odsc.com/boston">Open Data Science Conference</a>, held in Boston from 20-22 May 2016. This one was more intensive and extensive, exploring not just Visualization but also other aspects of Data Science such as Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics. It also had talks on the role and application of Data Science in domains which are traditional considered conservative with data, notably the government and the financial industry.
The conference was huge, with over 50 workshops and speaker sessions over 3 days and more than 750 attendees. The discussions were mostly technical in nature, with Jupyter notebooks and RStudio a common sight in presentations.

<h3> Takeaways </h3>
<ul>
	<li>It is indeed a wild west out there. There are differing views on how to approach Data science. One says you need to know the problem you are trying to solve, the other wants you to use data to discover problems. Same with tools and packages, there are rich libraries for both R and Python, which are the most common languages of choice, with some challenge from upcoming languages like Julia. </li>
	<li>
	For aspirational Data scientists, it is similar to being a programmer.
	Ideally, you are expected to have a strong math/stat background with command over data structure and algorithmic thinking, but in most cases you can get by without formal training. What's indispensible is knowing what to use, and when.
	</li>
	<li>
	Big Data is indeed tossed around too much. Anecdotal evidence- 4/5 people I talked to, said they did not have massive data sets, the maximum was a few hundred GiGs.
	</li>
	<li>
	Data Visualization is no longer just a tool to impress the data illiterate. Data Scientists are actively using it for feature exploration, finding trends, outliers and summarizing results.
	Active development in R and Python libraries, such as ggplot2, shinyR, seaborn and bokeh support this finding.
	</li>
	<li>
	There is a dearth of Data scientists in the industry. Even though no single person can know everything, yet requirements posted by companies are still <a href="http://insidebigdata.com/2014/01/09/data-science-found-unicorn-yet/">akin to finding a unicorn</a>. IMHO, this stems from the inability of companies to understand their own needs and instead giving in to the buzzword frenzy. Plus, as the article states, Data Science is about team work, not a one man army.
	</li>
	<li>
	Again, via anecdotal evidence of the people I networked with, there is a gap between Upper Management and Data Analysts/Scientists. The former either do not understand or are unwilling to move to Data driven decision making, whereas the latter might not be good at communicating the benefits of such an approach.
	</li>
	<li>
	The Boston Convention Center has some amazing food for a cafeteria.
	</li>

</ul>
<p>These, of course, are my opinions and you are welcome to differ.
	Now excuse me while I translate this energized mindset to work by applying all that I learnt to some data.
	Cheers.</p>
