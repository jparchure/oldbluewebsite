## About


I am Jay, as in Jayant.<br>
My last name is pronounced **Per**  - **Choo** - **Ray**

My previous work has been eclectic- From writing a <a href="https://github.com/jparchure/TeamAwesome"> Twitter account manager</a>, to a <a href="https://github.com/jparchure/StereoDrive"> web app</a> for musicians to create and share music Ã  la Google Drive, to writing a Tableau Web Connector for the <a href="https://github.com/jparchure/Arlington-cemetery-TWC"> Arlington cemetery</a>.

Currently, I work as a Senior Analyst, Business Intelligence and Analytics for <a href="https://www.target.com"> Target</a>, where I help the merchandizing team with localization efforts.
In my previous role I used to develop data visualizations for <a href="https://www.act.org">ACT</a>. During my time there, I also worked on applying Machine Learning techniques to problems in the education domain. <br>
I can write Python, JavaScript, R, Ruby and Java, in decreasing order of confidence.

Outside work, I helped incubate <a href="http://gdgindore.in/"> GDG Indore</a>, tried to maintain a personal blog thrice with varying degrees of success, and featured on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ8b9uTQr2U"> national television</a>.
I have also done some small consulting gigs for companies in the Iowa City area.

The proudest moment of my professional life was discovering a bug in a three year old Tableau API.
